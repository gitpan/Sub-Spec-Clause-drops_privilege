NAME
    Sub::Spec::Clause::drops_privilege - Add spec clause 'drops_privilege'

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     # in your sub spec
     drops_privilege => 1

DESCRIPTION
    Argument: BOOL

    This module adds 'drops_privilege' clause to sub spec. If set to 1, it
    specifies that sub drops OS privileges when doing its job. Usually this
    is for tasks that run as root/administrator.

    This module adds a wrapper code to make sure that OS privilege is
    restored. A sub might die in the middle of execution and haven't
    restored OS privileges yet.
